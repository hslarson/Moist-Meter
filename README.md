### Navigation:
- Clicking on '#' sorts videos by upload date (may be hidden on mobile devices)
- Clicking on 'Title' sorts videos alphabetically by title
- Clicking on 'Rating' sorts videos by score
- Search for a specific title using the search box
- Filter categories using the dropdown menu on the right side of the page

### Notes:
- The website only tracks "official" Moist Meters (i.e. YouTube videos uploaded by penguinz0 with 'Moist Meter' in the title)
- It is possible to add unofficial Moist Meters manually, but I can't ensure that I'll catch all of them so I'm choosing not to include them at this time
- Even though the video identification system is automatic, I still have to score the videos manually so new Moist Meters may take a day or two to appear on the list
- I'm trying to track 'Moisty' award winners, but this is a manual process and I may stop doing so later on. Moisties are marked with gold and brown drops next to the score (only visible on large screens)
- Use the email above to contact me if you notice any mistakes/bugs
